        <h2>Abstract</h2>
        <p>In recent speech processing applications, most approaches
            employ encoder-decoder frameworks with separate encoders
            and decoders for different modalities of speech and text. In
            contrast, we propose a decoder-only model called VoxtLM
            that jointly combines four tasks: speech recognition, speech
            synthesis, text generation, and speech continuation. VoxtLM
            integrates speech and text vocabulary, where pretrained
            self-supervised models are employed for extracting discrete
            speech tokens. Compared to the single task model, we show
            that VoxtLM exhibits significant improvement in speech synthesis,
            with improved speech intelligibility (reducing character
            error rate from 28.9 to 7.0) and improved objective quality
            (from 2.68 to 3.92). Additionally, VoxtLM outperforms in
            speech continuation and text generation and maintains competitive
            performance in speech recognition tasks.</p>
